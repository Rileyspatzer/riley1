Once you understand your reference position, you can begin glitching with more precision.   
   
To add your glitch image, simply find and delete the hero.jpg file in the project folder. Then name your glitched image file to the project folder and name it "hero.jpg."

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> Hi! I'm Riley and I was born in Winchester Virginia, but I grew up in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. I went to a small private school in center city Allentown called Central Catholic. I am a Psychology major with a minor is forensics. The goal is to end up in the FBI. I like to play soccer, go to the gym, and stay as active as I can. I don't have too much coding experience, but I do remember a speaker coming in to my middle school to give a speech on his career as a software developer. I thought it was so fascinating how he was able to develop entire apps and websites based off of mere combinations of letters and numbers. I never thought about that career path myself, however I developed a great interest in the process of coding.  </p>

Don't forget to add alt="text"-->

<!--Conduct your own Dear Data inquiry…collecting, analyzing, and communicating data (Shout out to Dear Data authors Georgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec). Use your built-in screen time monitoring features on your phone, tablet, and computer to assist you in tracking your technology use over 5-7 days. Then create a data visualization using colored pencils, crayons, or markers that tells the story of you and your data. Here's our framing question “How do you interact with technology and in what ways? (frequency and distribution of various activities.) For example: What apps get you through your day, what kinds of media are you consuming, what kinds of websites are you using?-->
<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Everyday Code</h2>
    <p> The Dear Data Project taught me alot about how I interact with technology and data throughout my daily life. I started by gathering a Weeks worth of Data from both by computer and my cellphone. I marked how many hours I spent on apps, how many times I opened an electronic, as well as how long I spent on an app per pick-up.I found that most of the weekdays I spent most of my time using school related applications, as well as listening to music. Typically, I only used socials and entertainment in the beginning and towards the end of the day. During the weekends,I saw how much later I was staying up and how I used social medias alot more frequently throughout the day. The data actually was refreshing to see, as I found that I balance my schoolwork and social medias well. I also went on my phone alot less that I actually thought I was - averaging around four hours a day. For me, this was a big improvement from how I used to be, which was pretty addicted to various social medias. </p>

<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Code and digital technology impact on education</h2>
    <p>I think that digital technology and code has changed the way we learn entirely. Almost every academic function we use today is entirely digital. Other than optionaly writing notes in my notebook, I have found that so far my college education has been entirely online. Even textbooks are becoming fully available online. Personally, I've always been a fan of a physical book because I always absorb the information better that way. Additionally, AI is becoming an increasingly large factor in education today. It's definitely cruicial to consider the fact that younger and older students have access to the answer to pretty much any question they can ask through features like chat GPT. While this can be a helpful study tool, academic integrity and plagarism also come into question when this software is used. Either way, I think that code has definitely improved education as a whole; It just needs to be kept in check.  </p>

<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Moving forward with digital literacies</h2>
    <p> I want to earn more about the field of coding and data. Like  said before, it was always something that peaked my interest. Before this project, I had never even considered trying it, as it always looked so confusing. However, I do want to further my knowledge ont he subject. I will definitely continue to moniter my data regarding technology usage. </p>
